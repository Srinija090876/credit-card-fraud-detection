# Credit Card Fraud Detection

## Task Objective
The goal of this project is to build a machine learning model that can detect fraudulent credit card transactions using a dataset of simulated credit card transactions. The model uses various features such as transaction amount, user ID, merchant information, and timestamps to classify transactions as fraudulent or legitimate.

## Steps to Run the Project
1. Clone the repository.
2. Install necessary libraries (`pandas`, `numpy`, `sklearn`, `imbalanced-learn`, etc.).
3. Open and run the Jupyter notebook (`fraud_detection_model.ipynb`).

## Key Features
- **Data Preprocessing**: Handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, feature scaling.
- **Modeling**: Used Random Forest Classifier to predict fraudulent transactions.
- **Evaluation**: Used metrics like accuracy, ROC-AUC, and confusion matrix to assess model performance.
- **Feature Importance**: Identified important features influencing model predictions.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- pandas, numpy, sklearn, imbalanced-learn, matplotlib
